    "\n",
    "For this assignment, you will craft arguments in favor of each side of a “would you rather” question. You must then analyze the arguments in full, making strong applications of all of the logical thinking HCs. The arguments can be as simple or as sophisticated as you wish! Keep in mind that more complicated arguments will require a richer, more careful analysis. This may be a good way to showcase your knowledge, but could also lead to more flaws. Moreover, in pursuit of the appropriate difficulty level, you’ll notice several “Optional” problems throughout the assignment to challenge yourself. These will only be scored if they are completed correctly with thorough explanation. If you attempt an optional challenge but do not succeed, you will not be penalized with a low score.\n",

However, in order to easily retrieve this information, I used associative chaining, and dual codes to create different representations of them, like tables and flowcharts. Other than learning principles, I also found using #heuristics to be helpful, especially working backwards, which I applied when identifying my premises since the conclusion was already present; and external representation, which allowed me to create a visual representation of the connection between the premises and the conclusion.  \n",

It was also interesting to see how real-world choice can be represented in codes to verify their validity; it made me realize that most things can be narrowed to mere 0s and 1s. However, the role of fallacies and inductive reasoning made it evident how formal logic falls victim to subjectivity as well, and though logical thinking can make many problems easier to evaluate, real problems cannot be accurately solved through it due to the paradoxical nature of humans.\n",

I spent some time figuring out Jupyter through trial and error and used CS50 Session 5 template to help me with my code, but as I modified it, I explained the steps of the code to myself to strengthen my understanding of it, which aided me in writing the explanation of the code.  \n",
